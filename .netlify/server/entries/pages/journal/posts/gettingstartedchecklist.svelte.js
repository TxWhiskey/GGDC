                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">Most homeowners aren\u2019t experts in building homes or getting them renovated after all, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll build one or two houses in a lifetime redo them two to four times at max. As a result, you can feel lost and overwhelmed and often end up spending more money than you should have on the whole process
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">So, whether you are considering building on your lot in Houston or renovating your existing home within the next coming year, it\u2019s a good idea to get familiar with the parties involved who play a crucial role in the house building or renovation process. 
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">As a Home Building Consultant in Houston, always looking to make home buyers and renovators lives, that little bit easier, I\u2019ve put together a full list of all the pivotal players you\u2019ll come across before building or renovating your home:
                </p></div></div></div>

    <div class="${"row svelte-aeomd"}"><div class="${"col svelte-aeomd"}"><div class="${"text-section svelte-aeomd"}"><p class="${"blog-text"}">Suppose you\u2019re thinking of obtaining a loan for building or renovating your home or want to cover a portion of the cost through financing. In that case, it\u2019s a good idea to start searching for which financial institutions to consider. 
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">After you do your research, you can go through the pre-approval phase to see whether you\u2019re eligible for the loan and what you need to do to get to the next step.
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">It\u2019s important to note that this is only the pre-approval stage; you will be able to fill out the actual loan application after you\u2019ve worked out your architectural and structural plans that the housebuilder in Texas can use to provide a construction budget. You\u2019ll have to submit this budget to the lending institution along with your loan application.
                </p>                
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">Ideally, you should start thinking about what your family will be comfortable spending and how much financing you\u2019re going to need. There is a lot to consider here, including the cost of the lot, down payment, monthly mortgage payment, and so on. Keep in mind that certain expenses, such as the builder\u2019s deposit, are not covered in the construction loan, so you\u2019ll have to keep a separate budget for that.

                <p class="${"blog-text"}">An honest and reliable realtor will ensure that you find a lot or home that meets all your requirements and your budget. They\u2019ll work to secure and close a good deal and will take care of all the necessary paperwork on your behalf.
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">Steer clear of any realtor who puts you directly in contact with the builder. A lot of times, realtors partner up with builders who offer a commission in return for referrals, leading to a bias. However, it\u2019s common practice for realtors to request a fee less than or equal to 3% of the construction cost if the builder they suggest is hired.

                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">During the pre-construction phase. A builder\u2019s job is to:

                <p class="${"blog-text"}">There is a lot more that a builder does but that falls in the actual construction phase. Custom home builders in Houston can charge $5,000-$10,000 separately for the pre-construction services.  This cost is usually applied to the construction cost if the builder is hired.

    <div class="${"row svelte-aeomd"}"><div class="${"col svelte-aeomd"}"><div class="${"text-section svelte-aeomd"}"><p class="${"blog-text"}">Typically, construction contractors in Houston, TX offer two types of contracts: either a cost-plus fee contract or a fixed-price contract. In the former, the builder\u2019s fee can vary between 10-30% of the cost, depending on whether you choose a builder who works on an individual basis or an established builder with a team. Renovations typically run at a higher fee because there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about the cost.
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">Most home builders in Texas prefer cost-plus contracts as they eliminate most of the risk, while in the case of fixed-price contracts, the builder carries most of the risk. When a builder offers a fixed price contract, they\u2019ll probably include a discretionary contingency lump sum to help mitigate any budget busts or unforeseen circumstances.
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">You should know that if you move forward with a fixed-price contract, the books will be closed and any savings will go to the builder (except for established allowance items).
