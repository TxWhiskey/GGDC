    <div class="${"row svelte-1d22ft0"}"><div class="${"col svelte-1d22ft0"}"><h3 class="${"section-header svelte-1d22ft0"}">A Brief History</h3>
            <div class="${"text-section svelte-1d22ft0"}"><p class="${"blog-text"}">I graduated from the University of Houston in 2014 with a Bachelor\u2019s in Construction Management. It wasn\u2019t the most popular career choice back then - and still isn\u2019t - but becoming a construction manager (or, more specifically, a client advocate) is something that I always wanted to do. For me, building a home was like solving the most puzzling puzzle - a minuscule, yet satisfying victory. So, for me, houses were my way of doing that, on a much greater scale. 
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">Whilst I was still at school, I landed a position at a commercial construction company here in Houston. I worked on high-end projects with luxury finishes and built a strong portfolio doing so. Although I loved this work, in 2018 I decided to shift into residential building. I transitioned for several reasons, one being that building homes was a lot more personal than building for a corporation. Building homes brought me the experience of working directly with someone who would be impacted by my work, on a personal level - something that still continues to motivate me to this day.
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">So, finally, I was doing exactly what I loved and my clients were over the moon with my work too but there was still just one thing missing - I couldn\u2019t be candid with my clients. 
                </p>
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">No. I wasn\u2019t lying to them; I just couldn\u2019t speak my mind if that meant disagreeing with my superior. 
                </p>                
                <p class="${"blog-text"}">I continued working in this same company for 3 years - until I decided to turn things around for myself and my clients. That\u2019s when the seed for Georgia Grace Collaboration was planted.

Dealing with all the parties involved is hard, especially when you feel you can\u2019t trust them entirely. Many home builders in Houston like to say they\u2019re the homeowners\u2019 advocates, but that\u2019s not really true. When a builder realizes they\u2019ve made a mistake during the bidding phase, I can assure you they will be quick to hide that mistake one way or another. There is no way a builder will eat that cost, in actual fact, they will often bury it amongst other expenses - at the cost of you.
                </p>

                <p class="${"blog-text"}">Having been on the other side of the table (as a builder), I saw firsthand how homeowners could feel alone, confused, and like no one was on their side during their home building journey - that\u2019s what needed to change and where Georgia Grace Collaboration comes into play.
                </p>

                <p class="${"blog-text"}">From award-winning architects to the best custom home builders in Houston, as a well-connected person in the industry, I have all the key players in my back pocket to make your dreams happen. And as your first point of contact, I will walk you through the whole process, from buying your land or home right up until the builder turns over the keys.
                </p>

                <p class="${"blog-text"}">I will help you connect with a realtor to sell or buy your existing/future home or lot, the architect that will produce the drawings to meet your manifestations, the interior designer to give your house life, and the builder to execute on the architect\u2019s, interior designer&#39;s and most importantly, your vision.

I\u2019ll get the builders to actually explain the \u201Cwhy\u2019s\u201D, instead of you just needing to \u201Ctake their word for it\u201D. So, in other words, I\u2019ll become your true advocate - the one without the hidden agenda, and most importantly, you\u2019ll get the very best.
