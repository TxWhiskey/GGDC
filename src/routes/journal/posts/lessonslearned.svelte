                    Recently, I interviewed a homeowner who had just finished building their dream home with a reputable custom homebuilder in Houston, TX. I asked this person questions about their home construction process, and about what they would have done differently if they were to go through the process again.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    <b>A</b>: We researched, “custom home builders in the Houston area.” We reached out and talked to 28 different builders to get a sense of who could do what we wanted, and who seemed to have a good track record of building truly custom homes.

                    <b>A</b>: We knew we wanted to buy in an acreage community where a production home was likely not a real option. We also knew we wanted several key details that we weren’t finding in any semi-custom plans (single story, trusses, bedrooms all spread out, etc.)

                <p class="blog-text">

                <p class="blog-text">
                    <b>A</b>: We were nervous in general since we had never built a custom home, and most of what you read online are horror stories.  We thought we were doing our due-diligence by taking the time to research and talk to dozens of builders, but we didn’t really know what to look for.

                    Building a home is a significant investment. And in order to feel 100% confident going into the home construction process, it’s important to do a thorough investigation into your potential builders. It takes years of experience in the industry to be able to know the right questions to ask as well as who to ask. As a home construction consultant with home building experience, I can ensure that the builder you choose checks all of your boxes. Signing on the dotted line is a big deal, and I want to help you make the best choice for you.

                    <b>A</b>: This is a loaded question.  Overall, our expectations of the builder were not met.  We ended up with a beautiful home that we love, but we feel that a lot of credit for that goes to the countless hours and nit-picking we put into the process.

                    <b>A</b>: At the beginning (pre-construction) there was a pretty regular meeting cadence, then it was more ad-hoc as construction got going.  I think I would have benefitted from a regularly scheduled meeting with the team rather than feeling I had to request meetings all the time.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    <b>A</b>: Yes, I think the custom home builder should work to understand and align on each individual homeowner’s vision.  I don’t feel like my builder did that on several details of my home, which caused re-work and dis-satisfaction on both sides.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    <b>A</b>: Yes, there are infinite details and decisions in the custom home construction process.  I often felt overwhelmed with all the moving parts, and I was nervous at the incompetence/lack of experience of some of the construction team.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    <b>Q</b>: As you received invoices to be paid did you look through every single invoice?  Did you ever say to yourself ‘what the heck am I looking at’?  Did you dispute any invoices that came through?

                <p class="blog-text">
                    <b>A</b>: I tried!  There were SO many… hundreds and hundreds of pages, many with short-hand or unclear descriptions.  I questioned a few and got good feedback from my PM and accountant, but with the pure volume of work going on, I’m sure things were missed.

                    <b>A</b>: Set very clear ground rule expectations from the beginning to make sure the builder is a good fit.  It will be different for each person, but I should have made it clear that I wanted a truly custom home, down to every detail.  My expectation was that these “details” were assumed to be part of the “custom” build process, but the builder often assumed the details would fall into place at a later time, which led to unsatisfactory results on certain parts of the home.

                    <b>A</b>: Even with a reputable builder, it will very likely take a LOT of time and effort to QC everything and ensure the builder is working on your behalf.  It’s a business and they will do what’s best for them.  This client representative niche is a necessary one that would have saved some of my sanity and probably will end up saving the homeowner more $$ than it costs.

                    Again, building a home is a huge investment. For many, it’s the largest sum of money you’ll spend in your lifetime.
